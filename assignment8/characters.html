        <h2>No-Face</h2>
        <p>No-Face is an enigmatic spirit in Spirited Away, known for his haunting mask-like face and ghostly, transparent form.

He seeks companionship and understanding, though his nature shifts dramatically when faced with excess or isolation. No-Face embodies a mysterious longing for connection, symbolizing both vulnerability and transformation as he learns to balance his desires with a more grounded identity.</p>
